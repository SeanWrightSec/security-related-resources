* [Proxy SwitchyOmega](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/switchyomega/) - allows for swtiching between proxies as well as switching to direct connections. This is useful when you want to quickly switch to sites which you don't want to show in your intercepting proxy.
* [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) - allows you to have multiple sessions within the browser. This is useful for testing access control related functionality.
* [Tab Reloader (page auto refresh)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/tab-reloader/) - automatically refreshes content in a tab. This is useful to keep a session alive, something which you may need when running a scan.
